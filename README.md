Map showing status of undernourishment and sanitation facilities in the world

With this visualization, I strive to answer two research questions: 1) what regions in the world are falling behind in hunger reduction, and 2) what is the relationship between hunger reduction and the state of sanitation facilities.

Interactive data visualization includes 2 tabs: tab 1 is a world map and tab 2 is an interactive histogram. 

The world map (tab 1) shows the percentage of the population that is undernourished. Countries with more intense colors have higher percentages undernourished. The circle markers display the percentage of population not using improved sanitation facilities. Bigger circles represent higher percentages of population not using improved sanitation facilities. 

Viewers can zoom in the map to look into countries or regions of interest, whereas the popup windows (upon clicking on the map) provide additional information about the percentage of population undernourished, or the proportion not using sanitation facilities. Furthermore, the “year” slider allows viewers to view changes over time.

Histogram (tab 2) is a quick visualization of the status of hunger in the world. Clicking the “Play” button in the histogram tab will start an animation of the histograms of population undernourished from 1991 to 2015.
 
This data visualization was created as part of a topic-contributed panels at the Joint Statistical Meetings 2016 (Chicago, IL).
